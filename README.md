# Online-Voting-Web-App

This is an online voting system with an administration panel. Web administrators in the admin panel can view the user (voter) information, edit the user information, as well as delete the user records.
The users should register with their personal information in order to vote (and the overall voting results will be updated in the database). Overall voting result can be shown immediately after voting, with counts and percentages. 

Three tables are saved in a database named 'php' in order to save different information. The 'musicians' table is used to store the voting results for each musician/pop star (Justin Bieber, Jay Chou and Shawn Mendes). The 'admin' table is used to store the login information for the web administrators in the admin panel. And the 'register_user' table is used to store the users' personal information (collected upon their registration).

This web application is built under the LAMP framework.

Note: 

1. The purpose of developing this webapp is to facilitate the digital research related to pop trend.

2. The online registration and admin panel functionalities are the same as those of 'Online-Registration-with-Administration-Panel' webapp, whose source code can be found in BarabaraLee's github.

3. It is required that each voter can vote for only one musician, and only one time. These requriements are not implemented into the source code considering the possibility of future change of requirements.

4. . See the folder 'OnlineVotingWebAppDemo' for the demonstration of using this webapp, with screenshots.
